# in Python, we can to utilize some ways about how to declare a variable
# See below:


myvar   = "Edu"
my_var  = "Edu" # Snake Case
_my_var = "Edu"
myVar   = "Edu" # Camel Case
MYVAR   = "Edu"
myvar2  = "edu"
MyVar   = "Edu" # Pascal Case

print(myvar)
print(my_var)
print(_my_var)
print(myVar)
print(MYVAR)
print(myvar2)

# In my opinion, Snake Case (line 6) way it's a better option to utilizate in Python
